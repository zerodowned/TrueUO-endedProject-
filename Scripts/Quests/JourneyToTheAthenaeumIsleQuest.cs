        /*Greetings, adventurer. <br><br>	As you know, my people have suffered the 
        * incessant onslaught of the Void and its minions for as long as Gargish 
        * history exists. Protecting Ter Mur from the darkness, and its desire to
        * consume the land completely, is a burden passed down from one ruler to another
        * upon ascension to the throne.  During my rule, I have been more successful 
        * than my predecessors but, now, I fear that the greatest evil both myself and 
        * my people have ever faced is about to return.<br><br>	Long ago, Ter Mur was
        * assaulted by the most formidable and horrid servant of the Void it had ever faced.
        * Called Scelestus the Defiler, this daemon proved invincible to any weapon or spell
        * that was utilized against him. I was unable to defeat him and was forced to 
        * imprison him instead. Sadly, my own daughter was caught in the spell and stands 
        * imprisoned next to the daemon. It has been this way for a thousand years now.
        * <br><br>	I have received word that the isle which houses the daemon, Athenaeum
        * Isle, is once again swarming with daemons. Based on the description provided to 
        * me, I believe these are the minions of the Defiler himself. They have no doubt 
        * crawled out of the dark in anticipation of their masterâ€™s return. In truth, the
        * prison I placed him within will not last forever.<br><br>	I ask that you journey
        * to the southwestern flight tower, adventurer, and head further southwest towards
        * the shore. Near the water's edge, you will find an ancient teleport site which 
        * will transport you to the isle. Once there, please slay as many of these monsters
        * as you can. Additionally, please keep your eye out for any documents that you may
        * discover. This isle was the former home of our Great Library and, when it fell, 
        * not all of the documents and books were able to be taken to the new location here 
        * in the Royal City.<br><br>	Slay the beasts and return to me any documents that 
        * you acquire.<br><br>	Be careful, and go with honor.*/

        /*You have returned! I cannot thank you enough for the service you have done me, 
        * adventurer. <br><br>	The documents that you have retrieved may seem unimportant 
        * to you, as they are naught but random letters and doctrines. But they each 
        * represent an echo of the past, musings of our ancestors. I had always meant to 
        * return to the former library and retrieve all that I could, but I had thought they
        * were safe, gathering dust in the ruins. I will immediately have these cleaned and
        * placed in the Great Library here in the Royal City.<br><br>	As thanks, I offer 
        * you this book. It is the chronicle of my life, of the arrival of the Defiler, and 
        * a history of my people. In hopes that you will be granted further understanding of
        * the impending danger we suffer, I offer it to you as a gesture of friendship and 
        * goodwill.<br><br>	Thank you again, on behalf of the Gargoyle people. I may have
        * need of your assistance at another time, should you be willing to come to my aid 
        * again.<br><br>	Until then, farewell.*/
